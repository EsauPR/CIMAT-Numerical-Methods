# Numerical-Methods

Implementation of useful techniques for numerical methods in ANSI C

## Project Organization


- *src*: It constains the core modules
    - *matrix*: It contains modules to read an write matrices and modules to make matrix operations
    - *linear_equations_systems_solutions*: It contains modules with algorithms to solve linear equations systems
- *homeworks*: It contains the homeworks with an example of usage for each algorithm inmplemented in *src*


Read the *readme.md* for each homework to know how it works.
